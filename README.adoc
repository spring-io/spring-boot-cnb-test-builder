= Spring Boot Test Builder

This repository contains a Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/builder/[builder] and https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/buildpack/[buildpack] that are used by Spring Boot integration tests.

NOTE: Use of the builder and buildpack by a CNB platform do not result in a usable image, but provide information that can be verified in tests to ensure that the Spring Boot CNB integration is working properly.
